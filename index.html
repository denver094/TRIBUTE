            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Tatsumi</h1>
            <p>Tatsumi is a young man of average height with green eyes and medium length brown hair with a cowlick that falls with its weight. He used to wear a white, high collar jacket over a tan sweater vest, a pair of black pants, brown gloves and combat boots, but later changes his outfit and now has a more traditional white assassin jacket over a slim purple hoodie and a black base layer shirt with black jeans. On his back, he carries Incursio's key, a short sword with a chain-link tassel at the hilt, in its sheath.</p>

            <p>He spent his whole childhood in a small village where he became close friends with Sayo and Ieyasu. It appears that he was well respected in his village as the elder gave him a unique idol of their god. Tatsumi also trained under the tutelage of a retired soldier, learning the art of swordsmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and blacksmithing. After Tatsumi, Sayo, and Ieyasu set off on their journey, they become separated when attacked by bandits, leaving Tatsumi alone.</p>
            
            <p>Using his skills in combat, he defeats the danger beast with ease. Later, he enters one of the Empire's cities, where he meets a young lady who offers him military connections in exchange for money, conning him out of all of his savings. </p>
            
            <p>At the streets, he is invited by a wealthy girl named Aria to stay at her house where he learned about the state of the empire, the corrupted Prime Minister who is the core of all corruption and about the assassination organization Night Raid from one of the guards of that house while staying there.</p>
            
        <p>Later, the mansion is attacked by Night Raid itself, witnessing their strength where they easily disposed of the guards. Tatsumi decides to find and protect Aria instead. Tatsumi then manages to catch up with Aria who is about to hide in her "storehouse" with Akame arriving to kill Aria and her guard, easily disposing of the latter. Tatsumi determined to protect Aria decides to fight Akame and after a struggle and almost being killed by Akame, the girl who conned Tatsumi out of his money earlier shows up, and is revealed to be a member of Night Raid herself interrupts the fight between Tatsumi and Akame stopping Akame from killing Tatsumi.</p>
            
    <p>The girl proceeds to reveal the true nature of the household with Tatsumi looking on in horror, shocked and disguised when he realized that Sayo were among the victims. Being at a state of mind where Tatsumi was no longer know who is right or wrong, Ieyasu who was captured as well reveals that Aria was the person who tortured Sayo to death. Aria then proceeds to reveal her true nature as she states her despise for Sayo, further disgusting Tatsumi and those around. Knowing the truth and no longer in doubt, Tatsumi stops Akame from slaying Aria as he proceeds to dispose of Aria himself out of pure anger and hatred for her actions towards his friends.</p>
            
            <p>Tatsumi was then forced to see Ieyasu succumb to the Lubora disease, leaving Tatsumi devastated over the loss of his two closest friends. Leone, the Night Raid member who conned Tatsumi of his money, impressed by his potential officially invites him to join their group of assassins. Tatsumi reluctantly leaves with the group (being carried off by them), and they head back to the hideout.</p>
            
        <p>Still devastated over the death of his childhood friends, Tatsumi was hesitant to accept Leone's offer to join at first. Leone shows him around the hideout and introduces him to the other members of Night Raid: Akame, Bulat, Sheele, Mine, Lubbock and then Najenda. Suspicious that they will kill him if he refuses, he asks what will become of him. Najenda assures him that they will not kill him should he refuse, but tells him that he would not be allowed to leave, and that he would be able to work for Night Raid as a laborer, earning money to send back to his village should he wish. She explains Night Raid's purpose and goals, and Tatsumi finally accepts the offer to join the Assassin's guild.</p>
